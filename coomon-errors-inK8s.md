Here’s a detailed overview of common Kubernetes errors such as **OOM (Out of Memory)**, **ImagePullBackOff**, and other frequent issues. Each includes the cause, resolution, and how to diagnose it effectively—important for interview scenarios.

---

## **1. OOMKilled (Out of Memory Killed)**
**Description**:  
A container is terminated by Kubernetes because it exceeded the memory limits defined in the resource configuration.

**Cause**:  
- Insufficient memory allocated to the container.
- A memory leak in the application running inside the container.
- The node itself is running out of memory.

**How to Identify**:  
1. Check the pod's status:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pod <pod-name>
   ```
   It will show `OOMKilled` in the container state.

2. Get detailed events and logs:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
   kubectl logs <pod-name> --previous
   ```

3. Verify resource limits:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe pod <pod-name> | grep -i resources
   ```

**Resolution**:  
- Increase the memory limits for the container:
   ```yaml
   resources:
     limits:
       memory: "512Mi"
     requests:
       memory: "256Mi"
   ```
   Apply this in the pod's manifest file.

- Debug the application for memory leaks.

- Scale the application horizontally if needed.

## **2. ImagePullBackOff**
**Description**:  
The container fails to start because Kubernetes cannot pull the image from the container registry.

**Cause**:  
- The image does not exist in the registry.
- Incorrect image name or tag.
- Lack of permissions to pull the image (e.g., missing credentials for a private registry).
- Network issues preventing the node from reaching the registry.

**How to Identify**:  
1. Check pod status:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pod <pod-name>
   ```
   The status will show `ImagePullBackOff`.

2. Describe the pod for more details:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
   ```
   Look for events mentioning `ErrImagePull`.

**Resolution**:  
- Verify the image name and tag:
   ```bash
   docker pull <image-name>:<tag>
   ```
   Ensure it exists in the registry.

- If it's a private registry, create a secret for registry credentials:
   ```bash
   kubectl create secret docker-registry my-registry-secret \
     --docker-server=<registry-url> \
     --docker-username=<username> \
     --docker-password=<password> \
     --docker-email=<email>
   ```

   Reference the secret in your deployment:
   ```yaml
   imagePullSecrets:
   - name: my-registry-secret
   ```

- Check network connectivity to the registry.

## **3. CrashLoopBackOff**
**Description**:  
The pod keeps restarting due to repeated failures in the container.

**Cause**:  
- The application inside the container crashes or exits with a non-zero exit code.
- Missing or incorrect environment variables/configurations.
- Resource constraints such as insufficient CPU or memory.

**How to Identify**:  
1. Check pod status:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pod <pod-name>
   ```

2. View the logs:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs <pod-name> --previous
   ```

3. Inspect the pod's configuration:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
   ```

**Resolution**:  
- Check the application logs for errors and fix the issue in the code or configuration.

- Ensure required environment variables or configurations are provided.

- Increase resource requests/limits if the application is being terminated due to resource constraints.

## **4. Node Not Ready**
**Description**:  
The node is in a `NotReady` state and cannot schedule new pods.

**Cause**:  
- High resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk).
- Network issues or misconfigurations.
- kubelet or other node services not running properly.

**How to Identify**:  
1. Check the node status:
   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

2. Describe the node for details:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe node <node-name>
   ```

**Resolution**:  
- Check resource usage on the node:
   ```bash
   top
   df -h
   ```

- Restart kubelet and other node services:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart kubelet
   ```

- Investigate the `/var/log/kubelet.log` file for errors.

## **5. Pending Pods**
**Description**:  
Pods are stuck in the `Pending` state and not scheduled on any node.

**Cause**:  
- Insufficient resources on nodes (CPU, memory, or disk).
- Node taints or pod affinity/anti-affinity rules preventing scheduling.
- No matching node selector.

**How to Identify**:  
1. Check pod status:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

2. Describe the pod:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
   ```
   Look for events like `FailedScheduling`.

**Resolution**:  
- Check node resources:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe nodes
   ```

- Adjust resource requests/limits in the pod spec:
   ```yaml
   resources:
     requests:
       cpu: "500m"
       memory: "256Mi"
   ```

- Remove taints from nodes if needed:
   ```bash
   kubectl taint nodes <node-name> key=value:NoSchedule-
   ```

## **6. Pod Stuck in Terminating State**
**Description**:  
A pod remains in the `Terminating` state for an extended time.

**Cause**:  
- Stuck finalizers preventing deletion.
- The pod is unable to stop gracefully (e.g., application doesn't respond to SIGTERM).

**How to Identify**:  
1. Check pod status:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pod <pod-name>
   ```

2. Force delete the pod:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete pod <pod-name> --grace-period=0 --force
   ```

**Resolution**:  
- Investigate the pod's finalizers and clean them if needed:
   ```bash
   kubectl patch pod <pod-name> -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":[]}}'
   ```

- Ensure the application inside the container handles SIGTERM signals gracefully.

---

## **7. DNS Issues in Pods**
**Description**:  
Pods cannot resolve DNS names, affecting communication with services or external endpoints.

**Cause**:  
- Issues with the `kube-dns` or `CoreDNS` pod.
- Network policies blocking DNS traffic.
- Incorrect DNS configurations.

**How to Identify**:  
1. Test DNS resolution from a pod:
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- nslookup kubernetes.default
   ```

2. Check the status of DNS pods:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n kube-system
   ```

**Resolution**:  
- Restart the DNS pods:
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout restart deployment/coredns -n kube-system
   ```

- Ensure the DNS service is correctly configured in `/etc/resolv.conf` of the pods.

- Check and fix network policies.

## **8. Unauthorized Errors**
**Description**:  
Access to Kubernetes resources is denied due to insufficient permissions.

**Cause**:  
- The service account or user lacks the required role or role binding.
- Misconfigured RBAC policies.

**How to Identify**:  
1. Check the error message when running `kubectl` commands:
   ```bash
   Error from server (Forbidden): <resource> is forbidden
   ```

**Resolution**:  
- Grant appropriate permissions:
   ```bash
   kubectl create rolebinding <binding-name> \
     --clusterrole=<role-name> --serviceaccount=<namespace>:<service-account> --namespace=<namespace>
   ```
